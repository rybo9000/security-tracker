### What technology is this built with?

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- REACTJS

### How Does It Work?

1. The system consists of Clients, Security Items, and Categories.
2. A Category defines a grouping of related Security Items.
3. A Security Item defines an aspect of security a managed client might have installed such as Antivirus or Web Filtering.
4. A Security Item MUST be assigned to a Category.
5. After defining the appropriate Security Items and Categories you can then create and adjust the active Security Items for different clients.
6. Lastly, you can run a report on a client to view their overall posture score.
